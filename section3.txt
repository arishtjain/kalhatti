Problem 1:
Blockchain works in a decentralised way. The blockchain gives power to end users rather than a single centralised authority in a democratised way.

Problem 2:
Blockchain serves a foundation for decentralised apps. The trust is handled in a very elegant way with the help of different consensus in different chains. It has an enormous applications. Particularly, the way we can transfer funds from one place to another without a centralised authority and in a seamless way got me fascinated.

Problem 3:
The most pressing challenge is the resources current public major blockchains required to run, which require enormous electricity consumption and storage capacities which are storing redundant data.
The close second comes to the adoption of new chain by large number of people to avoid 51% attack.

Problem 4:
PoW has an enormous disadvantage to it that this mechanism of consensus take up a lot of resources such as electricity and computational power.

PoS also has a disadvantage as it makes large entities more powerful in concluding on a consensus.

The efficient way will be to use both these techniques simultaneously as proposed in Ethereum to lower the cons of each mechanism but still implementing a workable consensus.
